# Introduction

A platform for point of sales integrate to payment gateway.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform POS Interface**: Built with Flutter for mobile-first experience, supporting both Android and iOS.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Real-time transaction processing through secure API integration.
- **RESTful Backend Services**: Developed with Flask to handle sales operations, authentication, and reporting.
- **Cloud Deployment (AWS)**: Hosted on AWS EC2 for flexibility, uptime, and deployment scalability.
- **Containerized Infrastructure**: Docker used to isolate environments and simplify deployment.
- **Reliable Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for structured transaction storage and reporting data.
- **Reverse Proxy & Routing**: Nginx set up as reverse proxy for performance and HTTPS support.
- **Version Control**: Managed with Git for team collaboration and change tracking.

## Technical Insights

- Designed modular REST APIs with Flask using blueprint architecture to keep the backend scalable.
- Integrated external payment gateway via token-based authentication and transaction callback handlers.
- Used Docker Compose to orchestrate development containers for Flask, PostgreSQL, and Nginx.
- Configured AWS EC2 instances with secure SSH access and Nginx as a reverse proxy/load balancer.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Handling secure transactions in an unstable internet environment**: Implemented retry logic and local transaction queuing when offline, with sync upon reconnection.
- **Syncing client-side (Flutter) and server-side (Flask) data structures**: Created shared models and validation logic to ensure consistency between mobile UI and API.

## Outcome

- Delivered a fully working MVP within 3 months.
- Enabled real-time payments with reduced transaction errors.
- Improved deployment consistency and rollback capability using Docker.
- Successfully demonstrated POS system feasibility for mobile-first markets.

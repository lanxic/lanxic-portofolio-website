# Introduction

An IoT-based system designed to monitor pH, EC, and nutrient levels in hydroponic plants, enabling real-time data tracking and optimized plant growth.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Sensor Data Monitoring**: Captures pH, EC, temperature, and nutrient levels through analog and digital sensors.
- **Arduino-Based Control Unit**: Utilizes Arduino microcontroller for real-time processing and sensor integration.
- **Threshold Alerts**: Sends notifications or triggers visual alerts when values go beyond healthy limits.

## Technical Insights

- Integrated pH and EC sensors with analog-to-digital conversion for accurate readings.
- Used Arduino Uno with custom firmware written in C++ for sensor polling and data filtering.
- Designed a waterproof casing to protect electronics in humid growing environments.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Sensor readings fluctuated due to electrical noise and water flow**: Applied digital filtering and signal averaging techniques to stabilize outputs.
- **Maintaining sensor calibration over time**: Designed manual calibration procedure and implemented periodic software-based recalibration prompts.

## Outcome

- Provided real-time, reliable environmental data for hydroponic plant management.
- Reduced nutrient waste and improved plant growth consistency.
- Created a prototype suitable for educational, research, and small-scale farming purposes.
